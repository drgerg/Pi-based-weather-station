# Pieces and Parts: Things you can get that make life easier

Getting the hardware part of this project together is not a trivial task.  I am hoping after a year of use I will be able to say it was worth it.

I have collected a few assortments of carefully curated odd things, the majority of which were purchased on Amazon.  That makes it pretty easy for me to share the list with you.

* [EDGELEC 120pcs Breadboard Jumper Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD2BWPY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1) - These are made from copper wire, unlike some which are made from copper-coated aluminum.  If you ever need to clip off one end and solder it onto something (like I do frequently), you will be glad you got all copper.
* [Litorange 320PCS M2 Male Female Nylon Hex Spacer Standoff Screw Nut Assorted Assortment Kit (Black) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D78PFQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I have two sizes of these standoffs, and they are wonderful.  Both of the kits I have contain multiple lengths of standoffs, screws, washers and nuts.  All nylon, and amazingly strong.
* [12v to 5v 5A Converter, DROK USB Buck Converter Voltage Regulator DC 9V-36V Step Down to DC 5V-5.3V 3.5-6A Volt Transformer Power Supply Module ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NALDSJ0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I have about 5 of these guys now.  They are rock-solid and versatile.  They make me happy.
* [HVAZI 320pcs M2.5 Nylon Hex Spacer Standoffs Screws Nuts Assortment Kit; Male-Female(Black) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWDSPT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - The other standoff kit.
* [18-8 Stainless Steel Flat Washer, Plain Finish, Meets DIN 9021, M3 Hole Size, 3.2mm ID, 9mm OD, 0.8mm Nominal Thickness (Pack of 100) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OK7GPO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Stainless Steel flat washers.  Part of the collection of Stainless Steel fasteners that I can't live without.
* [Honbay 100pcs 304 Stainless Steel M3 Square Nuts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPFLNBS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I learned the value of these square nuts when I assembled my Prusa MK3S kit.  More Stainless Steel fasteners.
* [iExcell 600 Pcs Metric M3 DIN912 Stainless Steel 304 Hex Socket Head Cap Screws Nuts Washers Hex Key Wrench Kit ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J44YXV3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I use these a LOT for projects that have Arduino or Raspberry Pi parts.  The 3mm screws are used more on my custom mounts than anything else.  More of the Stainless Steel fastener collection.
* [HVAZI Metric M2.5 304 Stainless Steel Button Head Socket Cap Screws Nuts Assortment Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076ZN18KZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - The Raspberry Pi has mounting hole in its PCB that accept these 2.5mm screws.  More of the Stainless Steel fastener collection.
* [CHENBO 620pcs 2.54mm/0.1" Connectors Wire Jumper Cable Pin Header Connector Crimp Pins Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077X8XV2J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Pins, Sockets, and plastic connector bodies of various pin-counts.  Use the tool below to crimp these pins.
* [IWISS Open Barrel Terminal Crimper Plier Tool for Molex Style DELPHI AMP TYCO Terminals Crimper Open Barrel 24-14 AWG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07476C1LD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - This is a pretty good tool. What I mean by that is, you can crimp Molex and other open-barrel pins with it, including DuPont pins and sockets, which is what we use with the Pi and such. The tool works adequately, and is cheap. A better quality tool like this is way more expensive. You will have to learn how to get good results with this (or any) tool. It is not intuitive, but it can be done, and once done, it's as good as a million dollar crimp.
* [IWISS SN-28B Crimping Tool for AWG28-18 Dupont Pins](https://www.amazon.com/IWISS-Professional-Compression-Ratcheting-Wire-electrode/dp/B00OMM4YUY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=B00OMM4YUY&qid=1583281304&s=hi&sr=1-1) - This is a tool I just discovered that is not very expensive and will deliver a better quality crimp.  I say that based on decades of crimping all sorts of connectors.  I may be buying this tool for my own bench.

I listed these parts because having a stock of this stuff saves me a lot of time and results in a finished product that works well and one I'm not ashamed to show people.  If you can afford to do so, I highly recommend you stock your hobby locker with these sorts of parts and pieces.
